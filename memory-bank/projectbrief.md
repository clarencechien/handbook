# Project Brief: LoveTravel_PWA_Handbook

## Core Requirements
Create a PWA-enabled single-page application (SPA) travel handbook hosted on GitHub Pages. The app must function offline, play background music, render Markdown content, and provide a password-protected admin view for the trip leader.

## Goals
- **Offline Reliability**: Ensure the handbook and music are available without internet access.
- **Dual View**: Provide separate experiences for regular tourists (public info) and the leader (hidden surprises/controls).
- **Atmosphere**: Enhance the travel experience with background music.
- **Portability**: Work seamlessly on mobile devices via PWA installation.

## Scope
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS (No build step required for core logic, using CDN for libs).
- **Content**: Managed via a single `handbook.md` file.
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages.
