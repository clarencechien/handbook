# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Documentation**: Updating `README.md` and Memory Bank to reflect the latest "Travel Agency" redesign and functionality changes.
- **Final Polish**: Ensuring all visual elements (icons, headers, fonts) are consistent and the user experience is smooth.

## Recent Changes
- **Icon**: Updated `assets/icon.svg` to a new "Travel Bag" design.
- **Auth Trigger**: Changed the admin login trigger from triple-clicking the title to clicking the "C&E" avatar in the header.
- **Header**: Redesigned with `Gaegu` font and "Japan Honeymoon 2025" title.
- **Layout**: Implemented "One Day Per Page" with scroll snap and "Postcard" style chapter covers.

## Next Steps
- **Deployment**: Guide the user to deploy to GitHub Pages.
- **Final Verification**: User to verify the live site on mobile.

## Active Decisions
- **Login UX**: Moving the login trigger to the "C&E" avatar provides a more intuitive (yet still discreet) entry point for the leader.
- **Visuals**: The "Travel Agency" aesthetic with tape effects, postcards, and vintage maps is the final design direction.
