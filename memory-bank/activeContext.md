# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Documentation**: Updating `README.md` and Memory Bank to reflect the latest "Travel Agency" redesign and functionality changes.
- **Final Polish**: Ensuring all visual elements (icons, headers, fonts) are consistent and the user experience is smooth.

## Recent Changes
- **Music Player**: Implemented a full-featured music player with a curated playlist (Suno AI), repeat modes, and offline download capability.
- **Admin Controls**: Added a Floating Action Button (FAB) menu for music and admin controls, accessible via the "C&E" avatar login.
- **Offline Support**: Enhanced Service Worker to cache music files upon user request (Download button).
- **Icon**: Updated `assets/icon.svg` to a new "Travel Bag" design.
- **Header**: Redesigned with `Gaegu` font and "Japan Honeymoon 2025" title.
- **Layout**: Implemented "One Day Per Page" with scroll snap and "Postcard" style chapter covers.

## Next Steps
- **Deployment**: Guide the user to deploy to GitHub Pages.
- **Verification**: User to verify the live site on mobile, especially offline music playback.

## Active Decisions
- **Music Hosting**: Using Suno.ai CDN for music files but implementing a "Download" feature to cache them locally for offline use, ensuring playback without internet.
- **Login UX**: Moving the login trigger to the "C&E" avatar provides a more intuitive (yet still discreet) entry point for the leader.
- **Visuals**: The "Travel Agency" aesthetic with tape effects, postcards, and vintage maps is the final design direction.
