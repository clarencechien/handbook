# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Visual Redesign and Polish.
- Redesigning the UI to match the "Itinerary2" aesthetic (Timeline/Card view, Romantic theme).
- Updating `style.css` and `index.html`.
- Ensuring the new design is responsive and PWA-ready.

## Recent Changes
- Generated `icon.svg` and updated manifest.
- Added Mermaid timeline to `handbook.md`.
- Updated `README.md` and Memory Bank.
- Committed initial core features.

## Next Steps
1.  Apply visual redesign to `style.css` (Colors, Typography, Layout).
2.  Update `index.html` (Fonts, Header).
3.  Verify the new look locally.
4.  Commit changes.

## Active Decisions
- **Design Style**: Moving towards a "Timeline" or "Card" based layout with a soft, romantic color palette to enhance the honeymoon vibe.
- **Fonts**: Will use Google Fonts (Noto Sans TC, maybe a handwritten font) to improve readability and aesthetics.
